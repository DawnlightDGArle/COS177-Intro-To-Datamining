The results between the Linear Regression, Simple Linear Regression and
Multilayer Perceptron vary slightly among each other. The Linear Regression
was the fastest, compiling and creating a model in 0.35 seconds while the slowest
was the Multilayer Perceptron at 2.06 seconds. The Linear Regression had the lowest
mean error percentage while the Multilayer Perceptron had the highest mean error
percentage. The Simple Linear Regression seems to be the easiest model to interpret
data from and translate into something different.
