The iris dataset compares and measures the sepal length, sepal width,
petal length, petal width and class of human irises. 

ZeroR
The ZeroR classifier was the least accurate, outputting a 33.3% rate of 
correctly classified instances and 66.6% incorrectly classified instances 
across 150 total instances. The kappa statistic for this classifier totaled
out to 0.

  a  b  c   <-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
 50  0  0 |  b = Iris-versicolor
 50  0  0 |  c = Iris-virginica

BayesNet
The BayesNet classifier was among the most accurate of the classifiers, with
a 92.6% accuracy rate across correctly classified instances with a mere 7.3%
incorrectly classified instances. The kappa statistic for this classifier came
out to 0.89.

  a  b  c   <-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 44  6 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  5 45 |  c = Iris-virginica

Logistic
The Logistic classifier was tied with the last three classifiers for the most
accurate of all the classifiers, with a 96% accuracy rate and a 4% incorrectly
classified instances rate. The kappa statistic for this classifier equaled 0.94.

  a  b  c   <-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 46  4 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  2 48 |  c = Iris-virginica

Attribute Selected Classifier
The Attribute Selected Classifier had an overall accuracy of 96% with an incorrectly
classified instances rate of 4%. This classifier's kappa statistic is also 0.94.

  a  b  c   <-- classified as
 49  1  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 47  3 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  2 48 |  c = Iris-virginica
  
Decision Table
The Decision Table classifier hd an accuracy of 96% as well as an incorrectly classified
instances rate of 4% and a kappa statistic of 0.94.

  a  b  c   <-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 49  1 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  5 45 |  c = Iris-virginica
  
Hoeffding Tree
The Hoeffding Tree classifier had an overall accuracy of 96% and an incorrectly classified
instances rate of 4% and a kappa statistic of 0.94.

a  b  c   <-- classified as
 50  0  0 |  a = Iris-setosa
  0 47  3 |  b = Iris-versicolor
  0  3 47 |  c = Iris-virginica
  
Overall, the models output by each of these methods were easy to understand based on
the confusion matrixes outputted. It's clear how each of the different clsssifiers went
through and organised the data based on the attributes. The most accurate
classifier was a 4-way tie between the Hoeffding Tree, the Decision Table,
the Attribute Selected Classifier and the Logistic classifier. The ZeroR was
the least accurate by farm with a measely 33.3% accuracy rate compared to the 90+%
accuracies output by the other classifiers.
